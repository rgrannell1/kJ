# kJ

kJ is a limited calorie-tracking that includes the features I actually use, without sharing health information with nefarious companies:

- minimal effort to enter what I ate in what quantity
- favourite a particular food or meal for easy re-use
- track weight & calorie intake over time
- allow for uncertainty in calorie estimates (how big _was_ that meal?)
- estimate survivable caloric intakes to reach a target weight, accounting for overeating and [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) effects in meals with underestimated calories 
- track overeating and the impact on weight change

I have a relatively repetitive diet so nutritional information of food will be curated manually, cutting out 90% of the work for this project.
